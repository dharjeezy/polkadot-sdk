//! Pallet that may be used instead of `SovereignPaidRemoteExporter` in the XCM router
//! configuration. The main thing that the pallet offers is the dynamic message fee,
//! that is computed based on the bridge queues state. It starts exponentially increasing
//! if the queue between this chain and the sibling/child bridge hub is congested.
//!
//! All other bridge hub queues offer some backpressure mechanisms. So if at least one
//! of all queues is congested, it will eventually lead to the growth of the queue at
//! this chain.
//!
//! **A note on terminology**: when we mention the bridge hub here, we mean the chain that
//! has the messages pallet deployed (`pallet-bridge-grandpa`, `pallet-bridge-messages`,
//! `pallet-xcm-bridge-hub`, ...). It may be the system bridge hub parachain or any other
//! chain.
