  description: |-
    - Fixes potential integer overflow in `CheckWeight::check_extrinsic_weight()` by
    adding saturating arithmetic methods to `Weight`:
      - saturating_add_ref_time(),
      - saturating_sub_ref_time(),
      - saturating_add_proof_size(),
      - saturating_sub_proof_size()
    - Includes test cases for extreme values
    - Improves debug logging.
